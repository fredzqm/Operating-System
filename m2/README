You can building executable files with make.
make -- create both bootload and kernel
make bootload -- create bootload
make kernel -- crate kernel from kernel.c and kernel.asm

Then you can run ./compileOS.sh to start the bochs simulator.
The simulator would exit and print out error messages if bootload or kernel executable files are not created yet.
